# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement makes an 'either/or' type of situation. It creates a right and wrong answer to the question/arguement. In this situation we use if/else to create a funtion that iterates until a condition is met that satisfies the loop. 

  Researched answer: A JavaScript code that assists with decision making, the conditional statement can either be true or false. The conditional statements execute a code if the condition is true. Conditional statements include: if, else, and else if. 



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is the what, Github is the where. We use Github to host our Git activity, pushing information from our local to a remote repository.   

  Researched answer: Git was developed in 2005 as an version control system, it can be used without internet access. Github is an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git versions. Git is installed and maintained in your local, Github is exclusively cloud based. 



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Boolean values are true or false, they are binary answers to a question. The operators include greater than, less than, equal to, and or, not, and a combination there of. 

  Researched answer: Boolean values are logical operators first created by George Boole in the 19th century. These operators helped create the first computer and now serve developers in creating logical statements via operators. Operaters include: ==, ===, %, fac&&, >, >=, <, <=, ||, !, !=


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the location of a element, like an address. Value is to index as type of house is to address. 

  Researched answer: An array is an ordered list of values, you refer to them with a name and an index. The index of a value is that value's location within an array. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is when you are given instructions and answer until giving a correct answer. You have to give an answer that meets the criteria of a correct answer. 

  Researched answer: A type of array methods, known as iteration methods, they operate on every item in an array, one at a time. Loops come in handy when wanting to execute a function a number of times, using different sets oif inputs each time. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Driver and Navigator. The driver has hands on the wheel and will be responsible for the actual typing out of the code. The navigator will be responsible for brainstorming ideas to overcome the coding roadblocks. 

  Researched answer: 
  Prepare: set aside time to do it, check in with your partner, make a plan, get comfortable. 
  Work closely together: driver writes code, navigator looks out for mistakes 
  Learn and facilitate learning: if you know more than your partner, this is an opportunity to help with their
                                develepment and vice-versa 
  Establish a rythm: every 15-30 minutes change responsibilites. If one solves the problem, the other can then change roles. 
  Communicate effectively: use gentle language, no one likes being interrupted, read body language, make space for conversation 
  Embrace Challenges: Things don't need to be perfect all the time, when it's not is when we learn the most 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that can take in another function as an argument or returns another function as an output. Examples of HoFs are: .map() and .filter()  

2. Jest: A Javascript testing framework, it's a collection of files that are managed by 'yarn' (yet another resource negotiator)

3. Objects: consist of collections of 'key:value' pairs stored in curly braces. The key is a data type of symbol, and the value is any data type in Javascript. JSON is the Javascript language to hold collections of data as well as being used to transmit data across a network. 

4. Method: When a function belongs to an object it is called a method, 'this' is a Javascript keyword that references the object. 'this' can be used to create a variable assessing the value within the object. 

5. Classes: A type of function that contain data and behavior, like blueprints of objects. Examples of classes are: constructor, this, and new. Class names use PascalCase instead of camelCase and objects are always lowercase.
